# subscribe-form

We need to create simple, but custom form for newsletter subscription.
If you can google - "graphql email form" and find what we can use - do it, might save us some time.
I wanna use GraphQL, because it's cool and might help us. Below check some tutorials.
We'll have form with 5-6 fields in it. Better to separate fields as subcomponents.

I wanna to be able to deploy it, maybe to Zeit NOW will be fine, so we can show/test it online.
